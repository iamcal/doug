doug - a simple bug tracker
===========================

Doug is a PHP & MySQL bug tracker for small teams. This first release is just a straight copy of our internal repo, with 
passwords removed - it needs a little work to get it to run standalone.

It uses our own flavor of <a href="https://github.com/exflickr/GodAuth">God Auth</a>, but replacing that with your own auth 
layer is pretty simple.

Installation instructions will follow shortly...
